- Prevent Caged Logicat from tiring out
- Panther Rush boost to increase the endurance of Caged Logicat
- Removed the 'of 1 needed' from sand display when castles are infinite
- Castle tool prices are always recalculated from scratch rather than subtracting previous price from current because the rounding errors are too much for reliability

- Fiddled with JDip levels and destruction amounts a bunch. A lot actually.
- Yeah I didn't get time to do other important stuff because I spent so long on JDip

## 2.63
- Some little improvements to Shopping Assistant and key unlocking

## 2.62
- ASHF should not be given if there are no boosts available and you have infinite castles
- Shopping Assistant no longer buys locked boosts (thus preventing weird zombie state for DoN or Crate Key or Castle Crusher prevening them from being given by department due to being simultaneously bought and locked)

## 2.6
- Castles are not built when you have infinite

- Prevent Catmaran and LCB from using glass if you have no relevant tools to boost with
- Infinite castles prevents Flux Surge, Temporal Duplication or Temporal Rift from being Logicat rewards

## 2.53
- Flashy badge was too hard on my phone 
- Fixed a price

## 2.52
- Deal with infinite prices (partially)

## 2.33
- Uh, how did that = get in there?

## 2.32
- Ensure Time Travel's power is 1 on buy (that was for a feature I never ended up making, whereby you could power up Time Travel to make bigger jumps. Now there's a better way of doing that.)
- Upgrade for person who has bought Time Travel and is stuck with it on power 0
- Apology

## 2.31
- Fixed erroneous save failed messages
- Factory Ninja is buffed based on logicat level

## 2.3

- This means 91 more badges are technically achievable

### 2.21

- Removed corn
- descriptions stay for an extra half second

- I'll test those some other time and maybe remove them if they aren't needed
- Supposedly they make sure boost descriptions update after you click a button on them

### 1.9
- BAG Power Unfortunately Necessitates Something
- Badge drawing refactor: now works just like boosts so it's neater and I can easily add badge categories
- Fixed RRR parentheses mustard
- 2 new Not Lucky boosts... which are pretty powerful but probably not enough for waveney
- Judgement Dip/Report are now not Alert by default, because if they are inactive they switch off after a mNP anyway, and now that you can save your Show/Hide state, it's annoying to see them appear and vanish on load
- Another Not Lucky boost and buffed the previous 2
- Now they're probably overpowered. I dunno. I'm 2 nopix late for coma.

### 1.895

- Some glass related stats on stats page
- Two wrong logicat answers are worth minus one correct answer now, so it's a little easier to level logicat.
- Sometimes logicat statements are longer.

- Fiddled with redacted timing, should work more consistently now
- Fixed incorrect number rounding
- When building or destroying castles, if the amount is less than 1/10000 of the castles you have, don't notify (the amount is added to the running total of castles to notify about later)
- Prevent "by the newpixbots" message from showing if the amount destroyed was not shown.
- Maximum judgement dip level based on newpix: Can't get Level 1 before NP12, level 2 before NP20, level 3 before NP24, Level 6 before NP34, level 12 before NP45...

- Temporal Rift and Flux Turbine descriptions/stats improved to reference each other
- Fixed import of totalCastlesDown - was parsing int rather than float so if you got too high it would truncate to single digit :P

- So it turned out the Panther Salve toggle was broken all along anyway
- Also made Panther Salve blue
- And refresh stuff when toggling it

- Fixed boosts out of order

### 1.6

- Added a boost which - surprise surprise - costs glass blocks

- a missing space in sand purifier description

### 1.54
- Prevent index from trying to Notify after loading
- Upgrade/downgrade refinery and chiller now cause sand rate to recalculate immediately rather than waiting for something else to trigger it (oops)

- index shows version I think. can't test locally!

### 1.531
- Probably fixed factory automation not working or upgrading for old save files (like mine)
- Can't see the probem with Glass Blower description yet, no time to debug right now.

### 1.53
- Fixed the clock hand. I didn't write any of that code btw :P
- Furnace Crossfeed toggle
- looked at the grammar of *its* description and realised that *it's* wrong.
- new Furnace related boost (you can probably guess from my recent discussion with waveney)
- because **its** description is copied from the previously mentioned, **it's** wrong as well.
- Gave Rosetta a new purpose. Also waveney-discussion related
- Rewrote postfix specification code using exponential notation rather than a squillion zeroes. Also waveney's suggestion (though no new postfixes yet)
- I guess I'll dedicate this update to waveney.
- Added some words and sentence structure. StormAngel helped a bit.

### 1.522
- what idiot wrote the _utf8_decode function I'm using?????

### 1.521

- More words and sentence structure rejigging
- Prevent Panther Salve from being too overpowered

- Added redundant information to the index
- Buttons at the top are bigger, and moved Molpy Down and Coma into options
- Sand Refinery downgrade button. Refunds 1 chip. (doesn't have detail about the effect on production but obviously it's the opposite of upgrade)

### 1.51
- Tweaked some sentence generation, added some stuff, fixed some mustard
- Adjusted blitzing stack effects (there was some mustard in the code, also I wanted to make it double BF/NL at minimum)
- Notification when ASHF and Temporal Rift are about to expire
- You have a chance of slipping into the Rift accidentally as you dig (when it's active but not immediately)
- Sand Purifier fixes

### 1.5
- Tweaked Blast Furnace (fractals helps it more), made base ASHF time 5 not 4 mNP
- Glass Jaw is now easier to unlock for those who want to use it sooner rather than increase glass block production
- Extracted the various redundarewards into their own functions for neatness and easier reading of code
- Set limit per NP of Glass Blocks available as rewards (based on chiller), further not-luck gives chips

### 1.42

- Trebuchet badge and boosts

### 1.22
- VITSS√ÖGEN, JA! stats falls back to show description once powered up
- Glass Jaw now doesn't unlock until you have upgraded Glass Chiller at least once

### 1.21
