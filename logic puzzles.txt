Solvable boolean logic puzzles.

1 statement:
A: A							unsolvable

A: !A							paradox

A: A||!A						true (tautology)

A: A&&!A						false (contradiction)


2 statements:
A: true
B: A							true
B: !A							false
B: A||B							true
B: A||!B						true
B: !A||B						unsolvable
B: !A||!B						paradox
B: A&&B							unsolvable
B: A&&!B						paradox
B: !A&&B						false
B: !A&&!B						false

A: false
B: repeat the above ten items but reversing A and !A


A: B
B: A							unsolvable

A: B
B: !A							paradox
(repeat the above two items in reverse for A: !B)

A: A&&B							A is false to avoid paradox below
B: A&&!B						B is false because A is false

A: A||B							A is true to avoid paradox below
B: A||!B						B is true because A is true

Can flip the !s around to reverse the roles of A and B or to make them unequal

A: A||!B						Same as A: !B, B: !A
B: !A||B						A and B are unequal but which is what is unsolvable


3 statements:
A: B
B: C
C: A							unsolvable

A: !B
B: C
C: A							paradox

A: !B
B: !C
C: A							unsolvable

A: !B
B: !C
C: !A							paradox

A: !C							true because C must be false
B: C							false because C must be false
C: A&&B							false because A and B are exclusive

A: B&&!C						false because B is false
B: A&&C							false because C must be false
C: A&&B							false because A and B are exclusive

A: !C							
B: C							
C: A&&!B						paradox: if C is true A is true and false while B is false and true, if C is false then A is true and B is false which means C is true

A: C							
B: !C							
C: A&&!B						unsolvable: consistent whether C is true or false

A: B&&C							false because C must be false
B: !C							true because C must be false
C: A&&!B						false: if it was true, B is both false and true

A: C							false because C must be false
B: C							false because C must be false
C: A&&!B						false: if it was true, B would be both false and true

A: !C							true because C must be false
B: !C							true because C must be false
C: A&&!B						false: if it was true, A would be both true and false

A: !C							true because C must be false
B: !C&&!A						false because A must be false
C: A&&!B						false: if it was true, A would be both true and false




A: C
B: C
C: !A||!B						paradox

A: C							true
B: C							true
C: !A||B						true: if false, contradiction



Generating puzzle:
Method 1: generate a contradiction, then provide an || "something that's true"
Method 2: generate a contradiction, then provide an && "something that's false"
Method 3: generate something that is valid in two states then add a contradiction to one possibility
Method 4: generate a tautological statement

Start with core, then add in some extra statements which branch off.


Core:
if 1 statement, make it a tautology or contradiction about itself
if 2 statements, choose values, decide &&/||, force one with a paradox
